Hello, and welcome to my blog site. My name is Sixtus Innocent, a computer science graduate and a practising software craftsman with experience in software design, engineering, and architecture.

I have leveraged my programming skills to proffer solutions in different domains: commercial, financial, and healthcare. Over the years, I have seen software engineering from a view point of craftsmanship, and this has been my guiding philosophy in my craft as a software engineer. A craft is an activity that involves the application of one's skills and creativity to create items that are appealing to the physical senses. Craftsmanship in software engineering is the approach of treating software development as a craft, focussing on creativity, skills, improvements, mastery, and quality. Hence, a software craftsman must be a learner in order not to experience a brain rot in his craft.

Furthermore, in my few years of experience, I have successfully applied design patterns, best practices, and architectures such as domain-driven design, test-driven design, event-driven design, hexagonal architecture, and clean architecture in production-grade applications.
