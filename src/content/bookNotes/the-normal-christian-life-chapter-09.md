Reasons 6 deals with the freedom from sin, while romans seven deals with the freedom from the Law.

Romans 7 teaches us a lesson that is rooted in Romans 7:5 and Romans 7:18, the carnal and flesh nature of man. The lesson is that we cannot please God in the flesh, which is a discovery mande by The Law.

Grace means that God does something for me. Law means that I do something for God.

Law is a demand from God to do something for Him, then He goes further to deliver me from the law which implies that He exempts me from doing it, and that in grace, He does it Himself. Romans 7:14

> We are all sinners by nature. If God asks nothing of us, all seems to go well, but as soon as He demands something of us the occasion is provided for a grand display of our sinfulness. The Law makes our weakness manifest. — Watchman Nee

The Law has been our school master to bring us to our knees, to reveal the condition of the flesh and carnal man sold under sin. Hence, God did not give us the Law to keep it; He gave it to us to break it, because He knows that we cannot Keep it. Romans 5:20; Romans 7:7-9; Galatians 3:24.

Why can't we keep the Law? Because the Law is spiritual, and it will take a spiritual man to keep the Law, but here the Law is given to carnal men to keep.

In Romans 6, the revelation between sin and the sinner is that of master to slave; In Romans 7, the revelation between the Law and the sinner is that of a husband to wife.

The Law places much demand on me but does not help me to carry them out. Is the problem the law of me? Obviously it's not the Law, because the Law is the Word of God, and it's spiritual, and the other end I am carnal.

Since I am married to the Law, and he does not help me fulfill his demands, how can I be free from Him? The only freedom from the law is death.

Who then should die? The Law or me? Remember the Law is the Word of God and it's eternal (Matthew 5:18). Since the Law cannot die, I can as well die and be free from the Law and be married to another husband that will help me fulfill the demands of the Law.

How do I die? Romans 7:4 answers this question, it says “Ye also were made dead to the law through the body of Christ”. This essentially means that we were in Christ when He was crucufied, died, burried, and resurrected.

- When He was crucufied, we were crucified in Him and with Him.
- When He died, we died in Him and with Him.
- When He was burried, we were burried in Him and with Him.
- When He resurrected, we resurrected in Him and with Him.

Whatever Jesus did in the flesh for our justification and sanctification, we were in Him and did that with Him.

Jesus is the end of the Law. When we died with Jesus, we were freed from the Law, and when we resurrected with Him from the dead, we were married to Him, and now He fulfills the law in us.

> Deliverance from law does not mean that we are free from doing the will of God. It certainly does not mean that we are going to be lawless. Very much the reverse! What it does mean however is that we are free from doing that will as of ourselves. Being fully persuaded that we cannot do it, we cease trying to please God from the ground of the old man. Having at last reached the point of utter despair in ourselves so that we cease even to try, we put our trust in the Lord to manifest His resurrection life in us. — Watchman Nee

> God is the Lawgiver on the Throne, and He is the Lawkeeper in my heart. He who gave the Law, Himself keeps it. He makes the demands, but He also meets them. — Watchman Nee

Pertaining forgivenss we look to Jesus on the cross; Pertaining deliverance form sin, the Law, and of doing his will the will of God, we look to Jesus in our heart.
