> Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him, for they shall eat the fruit of their doings. Isaiah 3:10

Every thing that God does is on a foundation he has established. Psalms 11:3

The foundation of every provision of God for man is righteousness. 2 Timothy 2:19

**Four dimensional ministry of the Word of God (2 Timothy 3:16):**

   All are done in righteousness

The resultant effect of man's rebellion in the garden of Eden nakedness. Man was stripped of honour and dignity as a result of sin. Genesis 2:15-17; 3:6-10

As a result of the sin of the first man Adam, God sent man out of the realm of plenty into the realm of lack. Genesis 3:23,24

> Until you step out of sin, you cannot step into plenty. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Kingdom wealth answers to those that have put away iniquities. Job 22:23,24; Malachi 3:10

It is given unto believers that live a life of purity to know the mystery of the kingdom of God, but living in sin robs one that privilege. A believer that lives in sin and an unbeliever will not have access to the mysteries of the kingdom of God. Mark 4:1; 1 Corinthians 2:14; Revelation 22:15; 2 Peter 2:20,22

God teaches those that reverence Him and His Word, hence the fear of God grants one access to the mysteries of the kingdom of God. Psalms 25:12-14; Job 1:1; Proverbs 1:7

**Two kinds of pleasures:**

1. Pleasure of sin — Enjoyed within a season. Hebrews 11:24,25
2. Godly pleasure — Enjoyed forever. Psalms 16:11

Kingdom prosperity begins with salvation. 3 John 2; Isaiah 51:3; Psalms 92:12-15

> Kingdom purity is what gives birth to kingdom wealth. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Wealth that is amassed through sinful means shall diminish. Proverbs 13:11

Seed planting does not equal to automatic kingdom prosperity. It's our walk with God that makes the difference. Your have to give your heart to God first, then the seed plantings will make sense and yield plenty harvest. Genesis 17:1; 5:24; Hebrews 11:5; Proverbs 23:26.

Every believer should practice holiness to remain in the realm of kingdom prosperity. 1 Timothy 4:7-15; 6:6,11

> If God chased man out of Eden because of sin, no man will live in Eden while in sin. Only righteousness qualifies any man to be back in Eden. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Kingdom prosperity is not for fools.

Who is a fool?
A fool is one that makes mock at sin. He/She plays with sin and says it does not matter. Proverbs 1:32; 14:9

> Your giving will never change your position, until you return to God in truth. — Bishop David Oyedepo

In sum, a complete departure from iniquity and a return home are the foundation for prosperity.
