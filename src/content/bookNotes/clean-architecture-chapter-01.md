**What is the difference between design and architecture?**

- There is no difference between architecture and design.
- Architecture is used at system high level.
- Design is used at system low level.

> The goal of software architecture is to minimize the human resources required to build and maintain the required system. â€” Robert C. Martin.

Architecture should be at the heart of the development of a software right from inception. Never buy into the lie that you can clean the code later and architect your software later just because you want to get to the market first. Why? Because once you get to the market, you are already in the game of competitors, and you are obliged with the never ending race of adding new features. This will result to not going back to clean things up ðŸ¥µ.

> The bigger lie that developers buy into is the notion that writing messy code makes them go fast in the short term, and just slows them down in the long term â€” Robert C. Martin.

In a nutshell, the software development team of an organization should take the full responsibility of taking their software architecture serious, and outline the need for a good software architecture to other stakeholders within the organization. They should also stand their ground on the decision to imbibe a good architecture in all their software irrespective of the pressing demand to get into market on time.
