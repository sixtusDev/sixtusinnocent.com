> My son give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my ways. — Proverbs 23:26

God wants us to give him our hearts first before giving any other thing.

The “give me your heart” in Proverbs 23:26 refers to dedication.

Man's heart is the door to access other things. When a man gives his heart to God, he can equally give anything to God.

What moves God is our heart. 2 Corinthians 8:6; Psalms 51:16-19

> Dedication is getting connected to God and his pleasures. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Psalms 92:13,14; 1:103; Isaiah 61:3 — To be planted means to be committed.

Being **dedicated** is not synonymous to **activity**.

> Until your life becomes a seed, planted in the ground of the kingdom, it will not have the colour God has ordained for it. — Bishop David Oyedepo

John 4:24-26; Ecclesiastes 9:4

Our transformation is a result of our dedication. Romans 12:1,2. Every seed sown (dedicated) to the ground will end up transformed into fruits.

Our transformation is sure when we are dedicated.

> Consecration guarantees you a place in heaven, but dedication is the mystery behind your distinction in the earth. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Your transformation in this life is secured when your life becomes a living sacrifice unto God.

**Transformations:**

- From shame to glory
- From poverty to wealth
- From sickness to health and wholeness
- From defeat to victory

A believer should attain to the realm where his/her givings is not pegged on material gain, but love for God.

John 10:18

Dedication is kingdom commitment and kingdom connection on the basis of love for God.
