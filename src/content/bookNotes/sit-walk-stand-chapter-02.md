All true experience in this kingdom begins from the stanpoint of REST.

> Sitting describes our position with Christ in the heavenlies. Walking is the practical outworking of that heavenly position here on earth. — Watchman Nee

> This I say . . . that ye no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk, in the vanity of their mind” . . . But . . . “that ye be renewed in the spirit of your mind. — Ephesians 4:17,23.

> Walk in love, even as Christ also loved you, and gave himself up for us. — Ephesians 5:2.

> Walk as children of light, . . . proving what is well-pleasing unto the Lord. Ephesians 5:8–10.

The literal meaning of “walk” in the above scriptures is to “walk around”. Figuratively it means to “to comport and to order one's behaviour”. In a nutshell is all about our conduct as Christians.

Read Ephesians 4-6; Matthew 5:38–48

After the fall of man that was a result of eating the fruit of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, he has devised means of deciding what is evil and good, right and wrong. But as Christians, our standard of living cannot be right or wrong. Our standard of living is but only the cross.

In fact, Jesus raised the bar for our daily conducts (see Matthew 5). For instance, Jesus said:

> Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt not commit adultery: But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust after her hath committed adultery with her already in his heart. Matthew 5:27,28

If they (Jews) could not fulfill and keep the law without fail, why then will Jesus raise the bar? This raises another question — How can I do it? It's a matter of His grace, for no man can fulfill the law except Jesus Christ. Alas God does not except us to do anything regarding fulfilling the law, for Christ now filfils the Law now in us in the person of the Holy Spirit that lives in us. So true, my friend don't dare try to do it by your own strength, just rest on Him.

The secret is, in the words of Paul, “the power that worketh in us” (Ephesians 3:20).

The christian life derive its strength and power by resting in Christ — This is the posture every christian must assume to live a victorious christian life here on eath.

Read Ephesians 2:10-13; 3:16,19

> The operation of His (Christ) life in us is in a true sense spontaneous, that is to say, it is without effort of ours. The all-important rule is not to “try,” but to “trust,” not to depend upon our own strength, but upon His. Watchman Nee

Our life is the life of Christ, mediated in us by the indwelling Holy Spirit Himself, and the law of that life is spontaneous, meaning we don't have to try whatever to please God, do his will, obey his commandments. We will fall in utter despair if we so try to do, because we will fall short.

> The greatness of His demands upon us only shows how confident He is that the resources He has put within us are fully enough to meet them. God does not command what He will not perform; but we must throw ourselves back on Him for the performance. — Watchman Nee

There is another meaning of “walk” which means “to proceed”, “to follow on”.

> Look therefore carefully how ye walk, not as unwise, but as wise; redeeming the time, because the days are evil. Wherefore be ye not foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. — Ephesians 5:15–17.

Scriptures that shows whatever the Lord does, He will finish it: Philippians 1:6; Jude 24; see also 2 Tim. 1:12 and Eph. 3:20

The unit of destiny is time. Walking with God here and living out the christian life here on earth is hinged on time. One cannot mature overnight, but time and practical walk with the Lord is required for maturity.

Revelation 14 there are first fruits (14:4), and there is a harvest (14:15). What then is the difference between harvest and first fruits? It is certainly not one of quality, for the whole crop is one. Their difference lies only in the time of their ripeness. Some fruits reach maturity before others, and thus they become “first-fruits.”

Jesus is seeking for first fruits. The “wise” in the parable are those who have done well at an earlier hour.

There is a privilege of serving the Lord Jesus in the future which His children may miss. Matthew 25; 2 Corinthians 11:2

In Matthew 25 it is not a question of the initial reception of Jesus Christ, nor yet of the coming of the Holy Spirit upon His servants for spiritual gifts! It is a question of the extra oil in the vessel—of the light being sustained, through however long a time of waiting, by means of the continual miraculous supply of the Spirit within (for whereas in the parable there is both a lamp and a vessel, in reality we are the lamp, and we are the vessel).

The oil represent the Holy Spirit, and it underscores the importance of constantly being filled with the Holy Spirit, and always ready and available for immediate use by the Lord.

Wisdom is connected with time and those who are wise redeem the time. Ephesians 5:16; 1:10-12; 2:7
