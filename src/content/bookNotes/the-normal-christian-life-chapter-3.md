description: "Knowing that we were crucified, died, burried, and resurrected with Christ is powerful, because we cannot experience the victory over sin without having this knowledge."

“If any man is in Christ, he is a new creature: the old things are passed away; behold they are become new“ (2 Cor 5:17) — Old life ends with the cross; new life begins with the resurrection.

**Important Facts:**

- Christ's crucifixion is a historic fact.
- Christ's death on the cross is a historic fact.
- Christ's burial is a historic fact.
- Christ's resurrection is a historic fact.
- That we were crucified with him, died with him, buried with him, and resurrected with him is also a historic fact that happened.
- We were all in him when he was crucified, died, buried, and resurrected.

The above revelation is important for us to live a victorious Christian life. We no longer need to be crucified, die, buried, and resurrected again, because we were in Christ when Christ accomplished them.

> All that is left for you to do is to praise the Lord that when Christ died you died also; you died in Him. Praise Him for it and live in the light of it.

Because you (the old you) are now dead, you are freed form sin. (Romans 6:7)

**How do you receive deliverance from sin?**
The same way you were saved, and received forgiveness of sins is the same way you will be delivered from sin. The way of deliverance from sin is to see and believe what Christ has done for us to set us free from the power of sin — We were crucified with Him and died with Him on the cross.

There is no human effort that can deliver a person from sin. It's only the knowledge and revelation of what Christ has done on our account for our deliverance from sin that can set us free from the power of sin.

> God's means of delivering us from sin is not by making us stronger and stronger, but by making us weaker and weaker.

“**Knowing this**, that our old man was crucified with him, that the body of sin might be done away, that so we should no longer be in bondage to sin” (Romans 6:6). The revelation of this my brethren is our deliverance from sin.
