> And I will give this people favour in the sight of the Egyptians: and it shall come to pass, that, when ye go, ye shall not go empty: But every woman shall borrow of her neighbour, and of her that sojourneth in her house, jewels of silver, and jewels of gold, and raiment: and ye shall put them upon your sons, and upon your daughters; and ye shall spoil the Egyptians.

God gave the Israelites favour in the sight of the Egyptians during their exodus from Egypt. Indeed they spoilt the Egyptians of their gold and silver. Later we saw in Exodus 22:2,8 and Exodus 35:4-5 that God demanded of the spoils to build Him a sanctuary.

> Speak unto the children of Israel, that they bring me an offering of every man that giveth it willingly with his heart ye shall take my offering. And let them make me a sanctuary; that I may dwell among them. — Exodus 22:2,8

> And Moses spake unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD commanded, saying, Take ye from among you an offering unto the LORD: whosoever is of a willing heart, let him bring it, an offering of the LORD; gold, and silver, and brass. — Exodus 35:4-5

In order of priority, God blesses us for His kingdom's sake, the advancement of His kingdom here on earth.

> Every gold you keep away from God will take you away from Him. You either worship God with your gold or you worship your gold. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Exodus 32:1-6

You need a heart for God to make a mark on the earth. Jesus said wherever your heart is, that is where your treasure is, and if you have a heart for God it will be evidenced in how far you can go for His kingdom. Matthew 6:33

When you keep your riches to yourself, it is for your own hurt. Ecclesiastes 5:13

> God won't bless you more that how far you are set to promote His kingdom. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Our giving should transcend the realm of giving for the sake of receiving to giving because we love Him and a token of acknowledgement that every thing we have is from Him.

When God gave the best to us (His Son, Jesus Christ), He didn't expect to receive anything back from us. Of His own will, He freely gave us His Son.

Get excited in the affairs of His kingdom.
