> Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, that ye should obey it in the lusts thereof. Neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin: but yield yourselves unto God, as those that are alive from the dead, and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God. Romans 6:11-13

Presenting our memebers unto God is **consecration**, but it's the consecration of the old man with its natural inclination like natural wisdom, strength, gifts, etc.

What must be presented unto God is the new man, not the old man. The old man must be crucufied, dead, and buried. The new man which is resurrected with Christ is what we present unto God as instrument of righteousness. Romans 6:13

The divine order of the new testament consecration is: Knowing, Rekoning, and Presenting unto God.

> When I really know I am crucified with Him, then spontaneously I reckon myself dead (Romans verses 6 and 11); and when I know that I am raised with Him from the dead, then likewise I reckon myself "alive unto God in Christ Jesus" (Romans verses 9 and 11), for both the death and the resurrection side of the Cross are to be accepted by faith. — Watchman Nee

After resurrection, God requires of us to present our members, all faculties wholly to him. Not some part, but the whole of our members. Romans 6:13,19

**Holiness** means separated wholly unto God. Exodus 28:36

**Are we servants or slaves?**
“Slave” is the Greek word “doulos”. The two words have different meanings.

**Slave**

- Slaves are persons in bondage and considered the property of another.
- Slaves are typically owned and could be bought, sold, and inherited.

**Servant**

- Someone that performs services to others, and have some degree of personal freedom and rights.
- Servants could work voluntarily for wages or could be in service as part of a household.
- Servants were often members of a household who performed domestic duties, and while they were under the authority of their master, they might not be considered property in the same sense as slaves.

We must realize that we were purchased by the precious blood of Jesus, which makes us to be bond servants (slaves). 1 Corinthians 6:19-20; 1 Peter 1:18-19; Revelation 5:9; Acts 20:28; Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:13-14.

God will always break what is offered unto him. After beaking it, he blessed it and releases it to meet the needs of others. In essence, after we give ourselves to him, he breaks us and touches every aspect of our lives: our relationship, work, career, ambition, etc.

> My giving of myself to the Lord must be an initial fundamental act. Then day by day I must go on giving to Him, not finding fault with His use of me but accepting with praise even what the flesh revolts against. — Watchman Nee

> I do not consecrate myself to be a missionary or a preacher; I consecrate myself to God to do His will where I am, be it in school, office or kitchen, counting whatever He ordains for me to be the very best, for nothing but good can come to those who are wholly His. — Watchman Nee
