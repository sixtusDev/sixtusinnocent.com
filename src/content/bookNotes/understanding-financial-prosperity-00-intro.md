Just like a father takes pleasure in the prosperity of his child, Our heavenly father (God) also takes pleasure in our prosperity.

> Until you are able to lay hold on his commandments, you never become a commander. — Bishop David Oyedepo

> You are not down because things are down. You are down because you don't have the light you need to be up. — Bishop David Oyedepo

All we need to operate in kingdom prosperity is light from God's Word. Isaiah 601:1; Job 29:3-6

The end-time church will experience a strange dimension of kingdom wealth and prosperity because of the end-time agenda of kingdom advancement, which will be earmarked by kingdom promoters enriched on the platform of the covenant. Haggai 2:6-8; Zechariah 1:17; Matthew 24:14

The plan of prosperity that God has for us has nothing to do with our profession and family background.

That you came from a poor family background doesn't mean you won't prosper.

God will prosper you irrespective of your profession, as long as your profession is legitimate. All you need to do to enter that realm of prosperity is to align with his covenant, which is accessible via his Word.

> The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, a good understanding have all they that do His commandments, his praise endureth forever. — Psalms 111:10

Fear of the Lord = Wisdom

> Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors is hard. — Proverbs 13:15

Good understanding = Favour

The day you see your prosperity from his Word through sound understanding, you will have it. Consider what God told Abraham in Genesis 13:14-15

> It is your level of understanding that determines your level of possession. — Bishop David Oyedepo

God's secret is what makes one prosperous. By gaining access and engaging those scriptures, you become prosperous.

God's covenant of kingdom prosperity is the advantage of every Christian.

What then makes the difference between a poor believer and a prosperous believer? It is the understanding and engaging of the covenant of prosperity.

> Prosperity is not just having money. It's a state of wellbeing that you enter into through the covenant of abundance. — Bishop David Oyedepo

**More Scriptures:** Psalms 35:27; Joshua 1:8; 2 Corinthians 8:9
