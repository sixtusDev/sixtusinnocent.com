description: "What's the next step after knowing that you were crucified with Christ? Watchman Nee explained the next stage after knowing, which is reckoning."
---

Once you know and have a revelation that your old man has been crucified with Christ, the next step is to reckon it.

You don't reckon that you are dead without first having a revelation of your death with Christ. The foundation of your reckoning is on the finished work of Christ (His death of the cross -- of which you were in Him when He dies on the cross).

> Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with him, that the body of sin might be destroyed, that henceforth we should not serve sin. In that he died, he died unto sin once: but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God. Likewise reckon ye also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin, but alive unto God through Jesus Christ our Lord. Romans 6:6,10,11.

From the above scripture, notice the progression; First, the writer said “knowing this“, hence, He was communicating a fact that we should know. The fact that our old man has been crucified with Christ — This fact is the foundation upon which our reckoning of our death stands.

You will not experience the deliverance over sin if you only reckon that you are dead, because everything that we are in the new creation stands on what Christ has done for us. You must have the revelation that you were crucified with Christ, before reckoning that you are dead unto sin. You were crucified with Him, and you died with Him.

Were you there physically with Christ, and died with Him? Were you physically crucified? Not physically, but God by his sovereignty put you in Christ so that everything that Christ did for your salvation, He did with you. What you got to do is believe — Faith is the acceptance of God's facts.

Is sin completely rooted out of us when we receive salvation, believe in the finished works of Christ — The things he has done to secure our salvation, and reckon ourselves as been dead unto sin? No, sin will still dwell in our body. (Romans 7:7)

> No, sin is not eradicated. It is very much there, and, given the opportunity, will overpower us and cause us to commit sins again, whether consciously or unconsciously. That is why we shall always need to know the operation of the precious Blood.

Since, our old man (the body of sin) that was slave to sin has been crucified with Christ, and died, it can no longer serve sin again. Sin the old master is present, but the body, which was the slave has being nailed to death on the cross. (Romans 6:6)

> As soon as we have accepted our death with Christ as a fact, Satan will do his best to demonstrate convincingly by the evidence of our day-to-day experience that we are not dead at all but very much alive.

The above is where many believers miss it. Because sin is still in your body, Satan will still exploit it and bring temptations your way that if not careful, you might fall into, thus resulting in experience that is entirely different from the fact of the Scripture. You must stand your ground and believe in what God has said concerning your deliverance from sin irrespective of your experiences, because that is a fact.

We don't know by experience the deliverance from the power of sin in one day, it's in increasing measure day by day, before we now gain mastery over it, after we have mastered the subtlety of satan.

Abide in me (Christ) and I in you —— This is the way to living victorious Christian life by experience. (John 15:4,5; 2 Corinthians 3:18; Romans 6:14). First, you abide in Christ, and then Christ does the rest.
