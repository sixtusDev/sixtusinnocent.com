From chapter 6 to chapter 9 of this book, the author explains why God prospers us with scriptural proofs.

There is nothing that God does without a reason.

> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing. — Genesis 12:2

You have to prepare yourself to be a blessing for God to bless you, and the level of that preparation determines the level God will bless you.

For your blessings from the Lord to keep flowing to you, you have to let that blessing flow to others by being a blessing, otherwise, the blessing will stop flowing. Genesis 18:2-5

God blesses us so that we can be a blessing unto others, and it is evidenced in our giving life. Genesis 22:15-18

Covenant practitioners are always excited in giving, they are always eager to give, and don't let any opportunity to give to pass them. Acts 20:35

We must realize the importance of the giving order; It first goes to God, and then to others around you.

It is not wise to give a man what you won't give God. God first before any other person. In the beginning God… John 1:1; Gen 1:1

One of the proofs of love is giving. You cannot claim to love God if you don't give Him out of the abundance of which He has blessed you.

God's kind of love is a giving love. Genesis 14; Galatians 6:10; 1 John 3:17; John 3:16
