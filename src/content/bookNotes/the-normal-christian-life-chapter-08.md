Everything that the Lord does is with purpose, He does not dispense his gifts arbitrarily, but on a definite basis.

**The gift of the Holy Spirit consists:**

- The Spirit outpoured (the Spirit upon)
- The Spirit indwelling (the Spirit within)

The basis upon the outpouring of the Spirit by the Lord Jesus upon every flesh that believes is His exaltation to Heaven.

The outpouring of the Spirit is not based on individual merits, but only to the merits of Jesus Christ — His glorification.

**Some Facts:**

- We receive forgiveness of sins on the basis of the death of Jesus Christ on the cross. Hebrews 9:22
- We reveive a new life (the Life of God) on the basis the resurrection of the Lord Jesus from the dead.
- We receive the baptism of the Spirit because the Lord Jesus has been exalted to the right hand of the Fathrer in heaven.

We were justified not by doing anything, but by accepting that the Lord Jesus Christ has done everything (his death, burial, and resurrection) for our justification. In the same vein, we reveive the enduement of the Holy Spirit by putting our faith in what the Lord has already done (his glorified).

> We work because we have not seen the work of Christ. But when once we have seen that, faith will spring up in our hearts, and as we believe, experience will follow. — Watchman Nee

> When our eyes are opened to see that the Spirit has already been poured out because Jesus has already been glorified, then prayer turns to praise in our hearts. — Watchman Nee

> Repent ye, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of your sins; and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For to you is the promise, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call unto him. Acts 2:38,39

**From the above scripture, Acts 2:38,39, we can derive the two conditions required to receive forgiveness and the Holy Spirit:**

- Forgiveness
  - Repentance - Change of mind.
  - Baptism - An outward expression of an inward faith that I have died with Christ, buried with Him, risen with Him.

The Spirit indwelling is the dimension of the Holy Spirit that dwells within a believer. Romans 8:9

> When we see Christ as Lord objectively -- that is, as exalted to the throne in Heaven -- then we shall experience the power of the Spirit upon us. When we see Christ as Lord subjectively -- that is, as effective Ruler within our lives -- then we shall know the power of the Spirit within us. — Watchman Nee

The reason why many christians do not experience a victorious christian life is not because they lack the indwelling Spirit but that they lack the of His presence. 1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 1:18

The Spirit of God that dwells within us is a Person.

True revelation of the fact of the Spirit's indwelling will revolutionize the life of any Christian.

When we know that our body is not ours, and that we are the temple of the Lord, consecration will follow this revelation. Revelation is the first step to holiness, and consecration is the second.

> Not until we take the place of a servant can He take His place as Lord. He is not calling us to devote ourselves to His cause: He is asking us to yield ourselves to His will. Are you willing for anything He wills? — Watchman Nee
