In the first conversations, Brother Lawrence learned GOD and the power of His Majesty through His creation.
“It happened in winter. He had noticed a tree stripped of its leaves. He realized that in a little while the leaves would return, and the flowers and fruit would appear. At that moment he clearly saw the Providence and Power of GOD.”

The above experience is an attestation of the fact that GOD's creation reveals Him, and we can learn GOD through His creation. Psalm 19:1-4; Romans 1:20; Job 12:7-9; Psalm 8:3-4.

Brother Lawrence advises that we should develop a sense of GOD's presence by feeding and nourishing our souls with high thoughts of God, and avoid the thoughts of trivial and mundane things. Matthew 6:24-34; Philippians 4:8.

Brother Lawrence advises that we should not dichotomize our devotion unto God in all the different aspects of our lives, including our physical and spiritual lives. He suggests that we should give ourselves wholly unto God in both mundane and spiritual matters, seeking only our satisfaction only in fulling His will whether it leads to our comfort or suffering. This suggests that everything we do have to be in service to Him.

Brother Lawrence made love the epicenter of his life and entire conduct. All his actions were love driven without the thought of self. For instance, He was pleased when he could pick up a straw from the ground for the love of GOD.

> GOD's love inwardly inspires us to do all things for Him effortlessly. — Brother Lawrence

Brother Lawrence was a man of humility and total and complete dependence on God.

**He said when any time comes for him to exercise some virtue, he prayed thus:**
“LORD, I cannot do this unless You enable me.” -- After the prayer, he received more than enough strength.
**Whenever he failed in his duty, He thus prayed in this fashion:**
“I shall never do otherwise if You leave me to myself; You must stop my falling, and fix what is amiss in me.” -- After the prayer, he stops thinking through it and continues his activities.

Whenever he does something well he gives GOD thanks and acknowledge that everything good that he does comes from Him.

He advises we should relate with GOD in the simplest language and sincerity of our heart.

Brother Lawrence prayed continually for GOD's grace to do his work well. Both the work he is naturally endowed to do and the one he is not naturally endowed to do.

Brother Lawrence never needed solitude to commune with GOD. His day-to-day work did not distract him from communion with GOD.

> Useless thoughts spoil everything, all trouble begin there. — Brother Lawrence

> All bodily spiritual disciplines and exercises are useless. All that is needed to bring us to union with God is love. — Brother Lawrence

Brother Lawrence revealed that the foundation of his spiritual life was a high reverence towards GOD in faith. Isaiah 33:6; Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 9:10.

> Sometimes when he realized that he had not thought of God for a while, he did not worry himself about it. After acknowledging his wretchedness to God, he returned to Him with even greater trust in Him, — Excerpt from the book.

For me, the keyword from the above excerpt is “worry”. I used to get worried anytime I miss my devotion with GOD — prayers and Word study. This insight from Brother Lawrence has opened my eyes to the fact that I don't have to mount pressure on myself anymore, for true Christianity is a walk of faith with Jesus. He is the one that helps our infirmities. Romans 8:26

> When outward busyness diverted him a little from the awareness of God, a fresh remembrance would come from God and consume his soul. This presence of God so inflamed and transported him that it was difficult for him to contain himself. — Excerpt from the book.

I believe the remembrance stems from an already established communion with the Holy Spirit, and I believe it’s the Holy Spirit reminding him of fellowship. John 14:16,17

Brother Lawrence advises that perfect surrender to GOD leads to sufficient light for our conduct, and he stressed that we should offer everything to GOD before doing them and give Him thanks after doing them. John 5:19;

**He said our communion with GOD should include:**

- Praises
- Adoration
- Loving him incessantly for His infinite goodness and perfections

He said that our sanctification involves doing for GOD's sake what we normally do for our sake. He did his normal activities without the intent of pleasing men, and only for the love of GOD. We should not be weary in doing little things for the love of GOD for He does not regard the greatness of the work, but the love at which it is dispensed.

Furthermore, He said that it's wrong to think that times of prayer should be different from other times. Love, faith, and hope is the whole substance of true Christianity. 1 Corinthians 13:13

All troubles and sufferings in our lives when viewed positively can be beneficial for our spiritual growth and development. 1 Peter 5:10

> O my God, You are with me, and I must now, in obedience to Your commands, apply my mind to these outward things. I beseech You to grant me the grace to continue in Your Presence. To this end I ask that you grant me Your assistance, receive all my works, and possess all my emotions. — Brother Lawrence's prayer before any work

**Brother Lawrence does these things when he finished his work:**

- He examined himself to ascertain how he has done his work.
- If he had done well, he gives thanks to GOD.
- If he had not done well, he asked GOD for forgiveness, without being discouraged he continued his practice of the presence of God.
