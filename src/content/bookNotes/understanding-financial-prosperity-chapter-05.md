> Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love thee. — Psalm 122:6

Prosperity is reserved for kingdom addicts (those that love the peace of Jerusalem). Matthew 6:33

Every believer must align with the demands of the covenant to enter the realm of divine abundance. Job 22:23; Malachi 3:7; Jeremiah 29:13; Psalm 16:11

> How addicted you are to the advancement of the kingdom, determines the level of abundance you enjoy. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Sow your heart first unto the Lord before sowing anything. Psalm 132:4,5

**Examples of God Addicts in the Bible:**
They all ended in greatness.

- David. Psalm 132:4,5; 122:6-9
- Abraham. Genesis 22:1-4,9-12,16-18; 13:2; 24:1
- Daniel. Daniel 6:5-28
- Three Hebrew boys (Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego). Daniel 3:14-18,30

God addicts heart beat in harmony with His heart.

If you are addicted to God, God will be addicted to you.

> When you become addicted to the law of your God, you have set the pace for the supernatural additions of His blessings. — Bishop David Oyedepo

**Addiction to God is when:**

- God takes hold of the whole of you.
- Nothing moves you like Him.
- Nothing stirs you on the inside like Him.
- He is all you are living for.

The signature of addiction to God is obedience, in other words, it's the proof of one's addiction to God.
