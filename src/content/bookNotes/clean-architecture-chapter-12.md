> Components are the units of deployment. They are the smallest entities that can be deployed as part of a system. â€” Robert C. Martin

Software components are self-contained units of software that encapsulate a set of related functions or data.

**Characteristics of Software Components:**

- **Reusability**: Can be used in different systems or contexts.
- **Replaceable**: Can be substituted with other similar components.
- **Independence**: Has minimal dependencies on other components.
- **Extensible**: Can be extended to provide new behavior.
- **Encapsulated**: hides its internal details from the outside world.

_Components interact with other parts of the system through well-defined interfaces._
