> Prosperity in the kingdom doesn't answer to fasting, nor does it answer to prayer, or prayer of agreement! It only answers to your understanding and practice of covenant details! — Bishop David Oyedepo

First, understand that your profession is not what determines your profession, it's your covenant position.

**What is a Covenant?**
A covenant is an agreement between two or more persons with a well-defined term that comes with a cost when violated.

God initiates the covenant, and we enter into it by subscribing to the terms in the covenant.

It's important to note that God's covenant is for our own benefit and not for God's benefit, because God is self-sufficient.

> My covenant will I not break, nor alter the things that is gone out of my lips. — Psalms 89:34

From the above scripture, it means God cannot break his covenant. We are the ones that breaks it, and when we do, it comes with a cost. For instance not giving, which is one of the terms in the covenant of prosperity will eventually lead to penury.

> Giving is living. — Bishop David Oyedepo

He has already initiated and authored the covenant, what you need to do is to enter into the covenant. 2 Chronicles 15:12,15

God's covenant is as new as the morning, it does not expire. It works anywhere under heaven. Genesis 8:22; Deuteronomy 8:18

God's covenant always prevails in spite of prevalent circumstances (famine, hunger, war, economic turmoil). Genesis 12:1-2; 9-10; 13:2; 26:1,12-14; 43:1,11

Hence, present circumstances are not the problem, but ignorance of the covenant of prosperity. Hos 4:6

Spiritual laws are higher than natural laws. Light rules over darkness. Romans 8:2; John 1:5,9; Job 22:29; Isaiah 60:1-3

Let your hope be on God and God alone, for He has established his covenant that makes for prosperity when you engage and subscribe to it. Don't hope in man, for the arm of flesh will fail you. Don't hope in the promises of men, for it is only God that has the absolute power to fulfil all his promises, man can promise and yet fail to make do his promise. Don't look at the present circumstances, look up to God alone, for He has the answers in His covenant. Psalms 121:1; Psalms 60:11

> Those who look around don't go far. Those who look up are the ones that go up. — Bishop David Oyedepo

Because of the covenant, the children of Israelites that dwelt in Egypt, in the country of Goshen did not experience the effect of the famine in the land. Money failed in Egypt, but the covenant prevailed. Genesis 47:13,15,18,27
