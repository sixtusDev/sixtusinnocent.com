> The God of our Lord Jesus Christ, . . . raised him from the dead, and made him to sit at his right hand in the heavenly places, far above all rule, and authority, and power, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come. — Ephesians 1:17-21.

> And raised us up with him, and made us to sit with him in the heavenly places, in Christ Jesus: . . . for by grace have ye been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not of works, that no man should glory. — Ephesians 2:6-9.

Christianity begins with SITTING, and not WALKING. It begins with DONE and not DO.

The entirety of our christian life is based on total dependence on the Lord Jesus. For His limitless grace is bestowed on us when we depend and rest in Him.

We rest our whole weight, including our burdens, cares, sickness, life, future on Jesus, hence letting him bear them and cease from carrying them. Matthew 11:28,29.

We are to see ourselves as seated in Christ. Luke 14:17

Our spiritual experiences in this kingdom begins with accepting by faith what the Father has done for us through Christ Jesus.

**Below are some facts on what Jesus did for us that we can rest on:**

- We receive the forgiveness of our sins because the blood of Jesus was shed on the cross and his death.
- We are delivered from sin and the old man because we were crucified and died together with Christ.
- We receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit because of the glorification of Christ.
- See Acts 2:33; Romans 6:2-4; Ephesians 2:5; 1 Corinthians 1:30,21; Romans 6:6,11

> The secret of deliverance from sin is not to do something but to rest on what God has done. — Watchman Nee
