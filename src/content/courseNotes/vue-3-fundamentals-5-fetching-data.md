## Fetching Data in Lifecycle Hooks

Obviously when we are building web applications, we don't only show static data to users. There is at most cases the need to display dynamic data coming from the backend on the UI, and in many cases on page load. So, how can we display data coming from the backend on the UI when a user visits a particular page? It's done in the Vue.js lifecycle hook.

### Vue.js Lifecycle hooks.

Vue.js application goes through different stages of initialization before it's finally created and mounted to the DOM. Vue.js exposes APIs called “lifecycle hooks” that helps us add operations at these different stages. Below are some lifecycle hooks in Vue.js.

- `beforeCreate`
- `created`
- `beforeMount`
- `mounted`
- `beforeUpdate`
- `updated`
- `beforeUnmount`
- `unmounted`
